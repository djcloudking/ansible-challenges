# Step 2: Run the playbook

- Make sure Ansible is installed on your system. If not, you can install Ansible using package managers like *apt*, *yum*, or *pip*, depending on your operating system. 

- In my case, I am using Ubuntu systems. For that reason, I can install Ansible using the commands:

    - sudo apt update

    - and sudo apt install ansible.

- Execute your playbook using this command: ansible-playbook system_setup.yml.

# Step 3: Review 

- Review the output to ensure the user creation was successful.
